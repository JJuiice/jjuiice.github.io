synopsis:
  "I have extensive experience in a variety of roles in the tech industry. This includes roles involving Systems Engineering, Embedded Systems Development, and some Full-Stack Development. 
  My motivation for any job I am involved in is being able to be a part of the process of identifying a problem, outlining a potential solution, prototyping, and finally seeing through the delivery of it.
  I have an avid interest in embedded systems and have been looking for more ways to get involved with such kinds of projects, especially if such projects involve work with prosthetics technologies."
