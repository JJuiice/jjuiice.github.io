header: Hi, I'm Ojas! I'm a fourth-year Computer Engineering student at the University of Cincinnati. I have an avid interest in tinkering with electronics and wrote my first "Hello World" in Java when I was 12. After feeling like a wizard that just learned a new spell, my inner nerd awoke to the world of computers. I was the electrical engineering and software development lead for my high school robotics team and have interned at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, GE Aviation, and Siemens Digital Industries Software where I explored a variety of roles in tech industry including R&D, project management, and software development. When I can convince myself to take a break from my projects, I practice martial arts and volunteer at my local animal shelter.
